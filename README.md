# Connect Four

Connect Four is a two-player strategy game where players take turns dropping colored discs into a vertical grid. The goal is to be the first to connect four of your discs in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## Game setup

- The game board consists of 7 columns and 6 rows (though variations exist).
- Each player uses a distinct color (typically red and yellow).
- The board is initially empty.

## How to play ?

1. Players take turns dropping a disc into one of the seven columns.
2. The disc falls to the lowest available space in that column.
3. The game continues with players alternating turns.
4. The first player to connect four of their discs in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
5. If the board is completely filled and no player has achieved four in a row, the game ends in a draw.

# Winning strategies

- Blocking: Prevent your opponent from connecting four by placing your piece strategically.
- Building Traps: Set up multiple winning possibilities to force the opponent into a disadvantage.
- Center Control: Placing discs in the central column increases winning chances since it offers more connection possibilities.
